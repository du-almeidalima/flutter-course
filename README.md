# Section 7: Meu Rango App

This is the repository for the Flutter course ([Flutter and Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/))
In this section I'll be building an Meal app, in which the user can search for meals, favorite and get to know how to cook them.

In here all my commits will be made with comments and the title of the lesson.


## Sections

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics
```
  "[section number] : [lesson number and title]"
```
