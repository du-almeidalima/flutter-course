# Section 4: Meu Dinheirinho App

This is the repository for the Flutter course ([Flutter and Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/))
In this section I'll be building an Expensive Tracker app, in which the user can input its expenses
an see the amount it expend per day of the week.

In here all my commits will be made with comments and the title of the lesson.

## Core Flutter Widgets

Flutter offers tons of widgets OOB, those are just some of the core. Also, there's a [cheat sheet](
./readme/core-widgets-cheat-sheet.pdf)
in the readme folder with more details of them.
