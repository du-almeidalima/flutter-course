# Section 10: Shopps App (HTTP)

This is the repository for the Flutter course ([Flutter and Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/))
In this section I'll be building an Shopps app, specifically in this section, I'll tackle how to use Animations
