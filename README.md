# Section 14: Firebase Chat App (With BLoC and Injectable)

This is the repository for the Flutter course ([Flutter and Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/))
This is the final course project that will apply everything learned so far. Furthermore, I took the liberty of applying the BLoC design pattern with the IoC using DDD.

The API is heavily based on Firestore.

In here all my commits will be made with comments and the title of the lesson.

## Sections

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics

```t
  "[section number] : [lesson number and title]"
```
