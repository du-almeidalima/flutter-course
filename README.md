# Section 8: Shopps App

This is the repository for the Flutter course ([Flutter and Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/))
In this section I'll be building an Shopps app, which will be focused on State Management in Flutter

In here all my commits will be made with comments and the title of the lesson.

## Provider Package

This is a pattern enforced by the Flutter team to deal with application wide state. It uses the
InheritedWidget behind the scenes

![State Provider](./readme/provider-package.png "State Provider")

## Sections

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics

```t
  "[section number] : [lesson number and title]"
```
