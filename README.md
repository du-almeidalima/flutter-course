In Flutter, similar to HTML and CSS, we have Widgets that can be visible, such as Text, Input...
And Widgets that works as structural or utility Widgets, and are not visible

## Stateless and Stateful Widgets

Similar to React Components, a Widget can be StatelessWidget(Dumb) or
StateFulWidget (Smart/Container). The difference is that, The StatelessWidget is only re rendered
or re-built if the input data changes. However, the StatefulWidget can store data inside it (State)
and if this data or the input data changes, it gets re-built
